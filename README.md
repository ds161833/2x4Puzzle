to the program is runable in two modes, solve and analysis mode
the difference is that the analysis mode will generate metrics for the runned code, 
while the solve mode will produce search and solution paths files for 
each of the algorithms for two heuristics

at the top of the file you can specify the mode. in main.py solve_mode and analysis_mode
also set the path to the problems files for both analysis and search
